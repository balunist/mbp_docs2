In-App Trial Activation
***********************

MapBoards Pro is provided to new and existing users as a perpetual license. An upgrade
is available providing access to additional features and functionality. The additional 
features are described as MapBoards Pro PLUS in the documentation and on the App Store.
To access the additional features a trial can be activated while running the app. 

To activate a trial, select either of these two new features and you will be asked if you 
want to start a trial. Confirm and the trial will be activated for 7 days. 

- An Arrange Type, Arrange with True Shapes, that uses Fusion's arrange to create a map
- Rearrange Boards, a post-mapping task that uses Fusion's arrange to rearrange a mapped board

The new Arrange Type and the post-mapping task are listed in MBP as options. Select 
either, as non-subscribers, and you will be prompted to activate a subscription.  The 
subscription is annual and if allowed to expire your entitlement will revert back to the 
perpetual license features of MapBoards Pro.
