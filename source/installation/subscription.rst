In-App Trial Activation of the PLUS Features
********************************************

MapBoards Pro is provided to new and existing users as a perpetual license. An upgrade
is available providing access to additional features and functionality. The additional 
features are described as MapBoards Pro :blue-bold:`PLUS` in the documentation and on 
the App Store.  Initially a fully functional 7 day trial is activated.  Once the trial 
expires, entitlement for the PLUS can be continues with a yearly subscription.  Like 
MapBoards Pro the entitlement is for a user ID. Therefore entitlement for PLUS features
enables its use on multiple computers.

When MapBoards Pro is run is will indicate the current PLUS entitlement status which
can be one of the following:

- No Trial or Subscription - only the perpetual license features are available
- Trial Active - all PLUS features are available for the duration of the trial (7 days)
- Subscription Active - all PLUS features are available for the duration of the subscription (1 year)

If a trial or subscription is active the status will be indicated in the Lumber tab
header as shown below:

If no trial or subscription is active the header will provide a option to start a trial, 
or subscribe, if the trial has already been used.

Alternatively, if you try to use one of the PLUS features when no trial or subscription
is active, you will be prompted to start a trial. If confirmed, the trial will be activated 
for 7 days. When The trial expires your entitlement will revert back to your perpetual license 
features of MapBoards Pro.  A subscription is available if you wish to continue using the 
PLUS features.  You can subscribe by clicking the subscribe link in the Lumber tab header.

PLUS Features:
==============

- An Arrange Type, Arrange with True Shapes, that uses Fusion's arrange to create a map
- Rearrange Boards, a post-mapping task that uses Fusion's arrange to rearrange a mapped board

Fusion's arrange accounts for the true shapes of components providing full rotation and
part-in-part for the best possible material utilization. See :ref:`arrange_type-label`
for details.

The new Arrange Type and the post-mapping task are listed as MBP options as shown in the
