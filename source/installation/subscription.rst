In-App Trial Activation of the PLUS Features
********************************************

MapBoards Pro is provided to new and existing users as a perpetual license. An upgrade
is available providing access to additional features and functionality. The additional 
features are described as MapBoards Pro :blue-bold:`PLUS` in the documentation and on the App Store.
To access the additional features a trial can be activated while running the app.

To activate a trial, select either of the two new features described below and you will 
be asked if you want to start a trial. Confirm and the trial will be activated for 7 days. 
When The trial expires your entitlement will revert back to your perpetual license features 
of MapBoards Pro.  A subscription is available if you wish to continue using the PLUS features.

- An Arrange Type, Arrange with True Shapes, that uses Fusion's arrange to create a map
- Rearrange Boards, a post-mapping task that uses Fusion's arrange to rearrange a mapped board
