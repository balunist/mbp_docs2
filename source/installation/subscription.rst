In-App Subscription Activation
******************************

MapBoards Pro is provided to new and existing users as a perpetual license. A new
in-app subscription is available as an optional upgrade providing access to additional
features and functionality. The additional features are described as MapBoards Pro PLUS in 
the documentation and on the App Store.

There are two primary functions available to subscribers:

- An Arrange Type, Arrange with True Shapes, that uses Fusion's arrange to create a map
- Rearrange Boards, a post-mapping task that uses Fusion's arrange to rearrange a mapped board

The new Arrange Type and the post-mapping task are listed in MBP as options. Select 
either, as non-subscribers, and you will be prompted to activate a subscription.  The 
subscription is annual and if allowed to expire your entitlement will revert back to the 
perpetual license features of MapBoards Pro.
