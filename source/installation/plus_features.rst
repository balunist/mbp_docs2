PLUS Features Description
=========================

MapBoards Pro PLUS features utilize Fusion's advanced native arrange
capabilities to provide improved material utilization and flexibility
when mapping boards for users with either the Personal or Commercial
Fusion 360 entitlement Plans.

The PLUS features :blue-bold:`Arrange with True Shapes` and
:blue-bold:`Rearrange Boards` are described in the sections below.


Arrange with True Shapes
------------------------

The new Arrangement Type, :blue-bold:`Arrange with True Shapes`, is available
when mapping boards with MapBoards Pro PLUS features enabled. The full compliment of
mapping options are available to customize the created board layouts.  In addition,
the full compliment of post-mapping tasks can be applied to the mapped boards including
SVG and DXF exports, report generation, manufacturing models, and the new Rearrange 
Boards. See :ref:`arrange_type-label`.

The image below shows the arrange type options including the :blue-bold:`Arrange with True Shapes`
option.

Rearrange Boards
----------------

The post-mapping task, :blue-bold:`Rearrange Boards`, is available to modify existing
mapped boards created with any of the arrangement type options.  This provides the
ability to customize the mapped boards by adjusting component spacing, trim on board
edges, and component flipping.  If changes prevent all existing components from being
placed on the boards, the user is notified with the opportunity to adjust the settings
to achieve a successful rearrangement.

The image below show the Rearrange post-mapping task being invoked.  It list the components
currently mapped on the boards with their 2D bounding box dimensions. Each listed component
has the option to flip or prioritize component placement order to help achieve part-in-part
placements if desired.
