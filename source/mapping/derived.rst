Creating derived model
**********************

    Steps to create a derived model

    - With the source model opened, select **Derive** from the create dropdown
      menu
    - Select the top level component in the browser tree to include the entire
      model
    - Select OK in Derive command popup to complete the creation

    You can now run MBP on this derived model.  If you wish you can save this
    model but it is not necessary since it can easily be recreated.  If you
    make changes to the source model the symbol |out_of_date| will indicated
    you are out-of-date.  Click the symbol to refresh the derived model.
