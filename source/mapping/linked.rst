Linked Assemblies
*****************

    Models which include **linked** components and assemblies **are**
    supported. A rare but possible limitations exist. If encountered you will
    be notified with a popup such as the following.

    This can be corrected in one of three ways.

    - Break the one or more links in the model that MBP is being run on then
      rerun MBP (the easiest)

      or

    - Derive a shadow model then run MBP on that derived model  See
      :ref:`Creating derived model <derived-label>` for details.

      or

    - In the assembly or component being linked to, name all component and
      do NOT use Fusion's automatically created component names, i.e.
      Component**XX**.  Instead provide your own unique names.

.. note::
    - The model containing a linked component or assembly must be a saved
      model and not an unsaved "Untitled" model or the above error will occur
      when creating a map with MBP
    - Creating a derived model is quick and easy and if you choose to save
      that derived model all changes in the source model will be reflected in
      the derived model allowing you to rerun MBP with changes to the original
      model.
    - Always ensure that you have removed maps created by MBP from assemblies
      being linked into another model. Clear the maps by first making them
      visible, turning on the visibility icon, then invoking MBP and pressing
      Cancel.
    - Remember to save any updates you make to the assembly and refresh the
      model where it is linked.
