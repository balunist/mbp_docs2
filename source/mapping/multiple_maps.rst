Creating Multiple Maps
**********************

.. role:: blue-bold

Maps are created under the component :blue-bold:`maps` in the browser tree.
With each run of MBP the existing visible map is deleted. You can hide a map
to prevent it from being deleted by turning off the visibility icon allowing
multiple maps to be saved with the model. The default map name is
:blue-bold:`map` which can be rename to identify it's content, i.e. a material
type or an assembly name.

The additional maps are saved when the model is saved to the Fusion cloud. You
can remove a map by turning on the visibility icon before you rerun MBP. All
post-mapping tasks are available on the saved maps and changes to each map are
saved when the model is saved.

A new Manufacturing Model task will create a separate manufacturing model for
the map it is launched on. Rearranging components on the map within or between
boards in the design workspace will be reflected in the created manufacturing
model.

You can switched between saved maps using the visibility icon next to each map
component.

An alternate way to create and view different maps is to use Fusion's Undo
list.

With each created map a single entry is created in the Undo list,
**Undo MapBoards Pro**. You can roll back-and-forth through the different maps
by doing an Undo (Cmd-Z), Redo (Shift Cmd-Z), ...
