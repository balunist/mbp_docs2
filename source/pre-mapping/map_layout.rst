Choosing Map Layout
*******************

    There are 12 ways to control the layout of boards in the created map. See
    image below. The layout you choose may be a decision based on preference
    or a requirement to match your manufacturing process. The settings you
    select can be set as defaults by selecting the **Save as Default** button
    on the options tab.

**Map Orientation**
    This should be set to match the **Z Up** or **Y Up** orientation of your
    model. MBP will create the map in what would be the TOP view for the
    setting you have selected. At the completion of map creation MBP will
    bring the TOP view into focus facing forward.

**Board Orientation**
    By setting the board dimensions, width and length, you can have the board
    oriented as portrait or landscape.
    **Width**
    - size in the vertical Y direction
    **Length**
    - size in the horizontal X direction

**Arrange from bottom up option**
    When this option is set the arranging of parts will begin from the bottom
    left corner. The default is to start the arrangement from the top left.

**Arrangement on Boards**
    The following settings are available with the **Arrange Type** option.

    Matching Widths Horizontally
        Component bodies are sorted by width and length in descending order.
        Bodies of the same width will then fill the board horizontally.
        This can be used for rip cutting when a board's longest dimension is
        horizontal and cross cutting when the longest dimension is vertical.

    Matching Lengths Vertically
        Component bodies are sorted by length and width in descending order.
        The board is then filled vertically top to bottom in columns from left
        to right with bodies of the same length. This can be used for cross
        cutting when a board's longest dimension is horizontal and rip cutting
        when the longest dimension is vertical.

    Fill Boards Diagonally
        Component bodies are sorted by length and width in descending order.
        The board is alternately filled horizontally and vertically starting
        in the top left corner of the boards. This should result with the most
        condensed layout. There is a random aspect to the fill pattern and
        is therefore nice to try when you are looking for another option.
