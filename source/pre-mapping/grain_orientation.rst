Grain Orientation on Boards
***************************


    By default the component's grain is determined by its longest edge. This
    can be overridden by applying a 3D appearance and enabling
    :ref:`auto_grain_align-label`. The Component grain determined by either
    method can be forced to rotated 90 degrees by choosing **Rotate** when a
    component has been selected as shown below.  See
    :ref:`Selection Support <selection-label>` for details.

    The component's grain will be aligned with the grain on the targeted
    board. Grain direction on the targeted board is selectable by toggling the
    double-arrowed icon horizontal (X) |horizon| or vertical (Y) |vert| for
    board types on the lumber tab or when optionally entering stock lumber.
