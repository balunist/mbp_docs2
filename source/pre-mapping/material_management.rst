Material Management
*******************
The lumber tab presents a list of materials and their thicknesses seen in
the model. With each material type you should provide a Width and Length
to be used as the default size when mapping.

**Optionally**, you can create and manage an inventory list of alternate
board sizes to be used **before** the default size is used. To create the
inventory, select the edit button |edit_button| next to the material type
under the title **Stock**.

The material list you create has the following properties:
    - defines the inventory of this material type that can be used across
      multiple models
    - can be commercially available board sizes you have or plan to use
    - can be scraps and offcuts of various sizes
    - defines the order material will be used, smallest first is recommended
    - defines a finite number of boards to be used before an infinite number
      of default size boards
