Material Management
*******************
The lumber tab presents a list of board types described by their materials and thicknesses
which is found in the model. With each board type you should provide a default size for Width
and Length to be used when mapping.

**Optionally**, you can create and manage an inventory list of alternate
board sizes to be used **before** the default size is used. To create the
inventory, select the edit button |edit_button| next to the material type
under the title **Stock**.

**The material list you create has the following properties:**
    - defines the inventory of this material type, which is available to all models
    - Can include commercially available board sizes you have or plan to use
    - can include scraps and offcuts of various sizes
    - defines the order in which material will be used (smallest first is recommended)
    - defines a finite number of boards to be used before an infinite number of default
      size boards
