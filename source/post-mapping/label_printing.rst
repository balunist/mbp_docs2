Cut List and Label Printing
***************************

    Save Cutlist is an option available in the options tab when creating a
    map. The resulting CSV file contains a list of all components included in
    the map with dimensions and material type. It is sorted by board number,
    width and length. It can be imported into a spreadsheet program and
    formatted for viewing. You can also easily print labels by importing the
    CSV file into Avery's online Design and Print utility.  By creating a free
    account you can save your custom label printing template for reuse.  Avery
    5160 is good choice for label printing. This video will provide guidance.
