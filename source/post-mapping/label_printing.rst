Cut List and Label Printing
***************************

    Save Cutlist is an option available in the options tab when creating a map. The resulting CSV file
    contains a list of all components included in the map with dimensions and material type. It is
    sorted by board number, width, and length. It can be imported into a spreadsheet program and
    formatted for viewing.

    See an optional way to print labels from the Cutlist csv file here:
