Rearrange Boards (Plus version only)
************************************

The post-mapping task  **Rearrange Boards** provides a convenient way to
rearrange components for the selected mapped board. It uses Fusion 360's native arrange
functionality to perform true nesting of components on a board providing full rotation
and part-on-part for the best possible material utilization.  

It will present a list of components on the board with options to prioritize the order,
helping with part-on-part placement, and a flip option to control which face faces up.
