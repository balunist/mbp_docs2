Label Map
*********


The **Label Map** task will relabel components that have been moved within or between boards.
The Label Map options allow you to play around with the font type, font size, and display units.
Options are available for including or excluding part number, component name, or both. The
font size ranges from zero to 5 cm. The component labels can contain either a board-specific
part number, a part name or both. You can slide the component dimensions, component label
or board label size all the way to the left to remove that label type.

.. note::
    - This option provide control over the height of these labels and you can turn them off
      by making the height zero.
    - If the space between boards is too small to fit the height you specify for board
      labels it will **NOT** include the board label.
