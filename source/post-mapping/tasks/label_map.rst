Label Map
*********


The  **Label Map** task will relabel components that have been moved within or
between boards. The Label Map options allow you to "play around" with the font
type, font size, display units. Options are available to include or exclude
part number, component name or both. The font size range is from zero to 5cm.
The component labels can contain either a board-unique part # or a part name
or both. You can slide the component dimensions, component label or board
label size all the way to the left to remove that label type.
