Sketch Map
~~~~~~~~~~


The **Sketch Map** task will create perimeter, cutout, and inset sketches of the components as
they are placed in the map. The sketches created are unique to each board component found in
the map on the browser tree.

The **Tabs** option, when selected, will modify the perimeter sketch to include tabs, which are
represented as breaks in perimeter loops. The size of the breaks and their distance apart are
based on the provided options **Width** and **Distance** respectively. The **Height** option, when not
set to zero, will result in an additional tabs sketch being created. This could be useful for CNC
users wanting to include tabs of a certain height.
