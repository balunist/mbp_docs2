Exporting the Created Map
*************************

There are several alternative :ref:`Map Output Type <map_type-label>` options that will export the created map in one
step, finishing without leaving the map in the model. This includes DXF files, SVG files or Report
Output. You may, however, wish to keep the map in order to use it in Fusionâ€™s manufacturing
workspace to create toolpaths to produce your model. The same exports can be done after a
map with component bodies has been created. Performing exports post-mapping provides a
way to rearrange the map before an export is performed.

There are a number of post-mapping tasks that can be performed on the created map object. It
is more efficient and recommended to create the map first before executing tasks on that map.
The tasks available include labeling, exports of SVG, DXF, Cutlist, and Report, and Manufacturing
Model. A description of the tasks can be found in :ref:`Post-Mapping Tasks <tasks-label>`. Be sure to try the Report
task, which will create an html file that includes a view of the map, cutlist, required materials,
and the MBP options selected to create the map. Report also provides an output type Print,
which allows the report to be saved as a PDF or boards to be rotated for better viewing.
