.. _fullpath-label:

Full Path Name
==============

.. role:: blue

When selected the full path is used to describe components. This would affect labels for the map and the 
exports svg and dxf. A full path name will also be included in the list of components shown in the cutlist 
and reports. Using this setting will insure that each part from your model will be uniquely identified.

Shown here is the Label Map task with :blue:`Use Full Path Name` option. This option is also available with 
the main app, MapBoards Pro, in the options tab when labels are selected. It is also available in the SVG 
export task and Report task.
