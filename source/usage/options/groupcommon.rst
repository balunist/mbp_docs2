Group Common Dimensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setting is available for both Cutlist and Report creation. When selected components 
with matching dimensions of the same material type are combined on a single entry with 
an additional column quantity representing the total count of matching parts. This is done for
each board and not across boards. The name field will combine part names truncating to fit 
the available name field.  Below is a resulting cutlist showing several parts with common
dimensions grouped.

Note: You do not want to select this option if you are using the list for printing labels
or you want a complete list of named parts.
