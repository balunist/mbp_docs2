Glass Boards
============

.. role:: blue

This option is available in the option tab of the MapBoards Pro app.  When creating 
a map with component bodies boards will be create in full thickness as :blue:`glass`.

This option makes no functional difference and it is purely for looks.  The boards 
are made non-selectable so you can easily slide components around to reposition.
I added this option because I liked the effects.  Use it if you wish.

:blue:`Note:` Selected this option has no functional affect, including in a manufacturing 
model, since the Manufacturing Model task will create a setup with appropriate thickness
with of without the board showing thickness.   It is purely for aesthetics.
