Software Updates
================

Make certain the **Software Updates** setting is enabled in setting. This will insure that important
add-in updates are downloaded in a timely manor avoiding interruptions. When set and the add-in is run updates are
downloaded, when available, that include changes needed to remain compatible with Fusion 360. If not set you may 
need to download and rerun the updated installer from App Store.

Shown below is the **Software Updates** setting. When set the add-in will automatically download and install
the latest version that has been verified to be compatiple with the production version of Fusion 360.
