Cut List and Label Printing
===========================

    Save Cutlist is an option available in the options tab when creating a map. The resulting CSV file 
    contains a list of all components included in the map with dimensions and material type. It is sorted 
    by board number, width and length. It can be imported into a spreadsheet program and formatted for 
    viewing. You can also easily print labels by importing the CSV file into Avery's online Design and 
    Print utility.  By creating a free account you can save your custom label printing template for reuse. 
    Avery 5160 is good choice for label printing. This video will provide guidance.
