Creating derived model
======================

    Steps to create a derived model
    
    - With the source model opened, select **Derive** from the create dropdown menu
    - Select the top level component in the browser tree to include the entire model
    - Select OK in Derive command popup to complete the creation 
    
    You can now run MBP on this derived model.  If you wish you can save this model but it 
    is not necessary since it can easily be recreated.  If you make changes to the source 
    model the symbol |out_of_date| will indicated you are out-of-date.  Click the symbol 
    to refresh the derived model.
