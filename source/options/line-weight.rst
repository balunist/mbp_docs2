Line Weight
===========

.. role:: blue

This setting controls the thickness of the lines in an SVG export. The Line
Weight setting represents the thickness of the lines as a floating point
number in the default units.  The value can be very small for thin lines to
very large for thick lines.

This together with line color provide more control for laser cutting.

Shown below is a :blue:`Linewright` of 0.254 mm for the task Export Map to SVG.
