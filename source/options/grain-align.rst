Automatic Grain Alignment
=========================


Setting this option will automatically rotate parts 90 degrees, if needed, to
align the grain with the targeted board's grain direction which can be
configured to be horizontal or vertical. This will only affect parts that have
3D appearances applied such as appearances found in the  **Wood (Solid)**
category.

Wood grain is often aligned along the longest edge length which matches MBP
mapping. MBP will by default align the longest edge with the targeted board's
grain direction. The Texture Map Controls, available by right-click on a
select part, can be used to rotate the visible grain to make it more
aesthetically pleasing. Shown here is Texture Map Controls being used to
rotate the grain 90 degrees on a cabinet side and the resulting map created
for this side when this option is set. The side is vertically oriented but the
grain is horizontal matching the targeted board's grain which in this case was
set to horizontal on the created map.


**Note:** The parts must be contained in a fusion component in order for grain
alignment to work reliably.
