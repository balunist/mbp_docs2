.. _fullpath-label:

Full Path Name
==============

.. role:: blue

When selected, the full path is used to describe components. This would affect labels for
the map and its SVG or DXF exports. A full path name will also be included in the list of
components shown in the Cutlist and Reports. Using this setting will ensure that each
component from your model will be uniquely identified.

Shown here is the Label Map task with :blue:`Use Full Path Name` option. This option is also
available with the main app, MapBoards Pro, in the options tab when labels are
selected. It is also available in the SVG export and Report tasks.
