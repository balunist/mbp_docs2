.. _group_common-label:

Group Common Dimensions
=======================

This setting is available for both Cutlist and Report creation. When selected
components with matching dimensions of the same material type are combined on
a single entry with an additional column quantity representing the total count
of matching parts. This is done for each board and not across boards. The name
field will combine part names truncating to fit the available name field.
Below is a resulting cutlist showing several parts with common dimensions
grouped.

Note: You do not want to select this option if you are using the list for
printing labels or you want a complete list of named parts.
