Group Common Dimensions
=======================

This setting is available for both Cutlist and Report creation. When selected, components
with matching dimensions of the same material type are combined in a single entry, with
an additional column quantity representing the total count of matching components.
This is done for each board, not across boards. The name field will combine component
names, truncating them to fit the available space in the name field. Below is a resulting
Cutlist showing several components grouped by common dimensions.

**Note:** Do not select this option if you are using the list for printing labels or want a
complete list of named components.
