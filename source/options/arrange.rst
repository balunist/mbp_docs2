Arrange Type
============


Matching Widths Horizontally
    Component bodies are sorted by width and length in descending order.
    Bodies of the same width will then fill the board horizontally.
    This can be used for rip cutting when a board`s longest dimension is
    horizontal and cross cutting when the longest dimension is vertical.

Matching Lengths Vertically
    Component bodies are sorted by length and width in descending order.
    The board is then filled vertically top to bottom in columns from left to
    right with bodies of the same length. This can be used for cross
    cutting when a board`s longest dimension is horizontal and rip cutting
    when the longest dimension is vertical.

Fill Boards Diagonally
    Component bodies are sorted by length and width in descending order.
    The board is alternately filled horizontally and vertically starting in
    the top left corner of the boards. This should result with the most
    condensed layout. There is a random aspect to the fill pattern and
    is therefore nice to try when you are looking for another option.
