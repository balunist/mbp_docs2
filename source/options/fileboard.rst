File for Each Board
===================

With this option set a separate file will be created for each board, for both SVG or DXF exports.  
The export will create a directory with a name matching the model name.  An exported file, SVG or DXF,
will be exported for each mapped board with a name matching the board type and a board instance number.

Showed below is the resulting SVG file export for two mapped boards.  DXF exports would have an 
identical structure but with DXF files.
