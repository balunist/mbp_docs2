Gray Scale
==========

This is an SVG and Report export color option for **Insets**. When selected it
will produce a varying grayscale color, the lighter gray for deeper inset
pockets and the darker gray for shallow inset pockets. This can provide an
infinite number of depths which can be used for toolpath creation.
