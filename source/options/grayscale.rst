Gray Scale
==========

This is a color option for **Insets** available for SVG and Report exports. When selected, it
will produce a varying grayscale color, using the lighter gray for deeper inset pockets and
the darker gray for shallow inset pockets. This can provide an infinite number of depths
which can be used for toolpath creation.
