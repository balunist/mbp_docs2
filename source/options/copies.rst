Copies Option
=============

.. role:: blue

This option maps multiple copies of the current selection or, if the option 
:blue:`Include Entire Model` is selected, it will map multiple copies of the entire model.

When set to one, the default, only one copy of each component will be mapped with the
option to set the quantity for individually selected components.
