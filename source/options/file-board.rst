.. _file_board-label:

File for Each Board
===================

With this option set, a separate file will be created for each board, including both SVG or
DXF exports. The export will create a directory with a name matching the modelâ€™s. An
SVG or DXF file will be exported for each mapped board with a name matching the board
type and instance number.

Shown below is the resulting SVG file export for two mapped boards. DXF exports will
have an identical structure.
