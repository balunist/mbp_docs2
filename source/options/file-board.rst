.. _file_board-label:

File for Each Board
===================

With this option set a separate file will be created for each board, for both
SVG or DXF exports. The export will create a directory with a name matching
the model name.  An exported file, SVG or DXF, will be exported for each
mapped board with a name matching the board type and a board instance number.

Showed below is the resulting SVG file export for two mapped boards.  DXF
exports would have an identical structure but with DXF files.
