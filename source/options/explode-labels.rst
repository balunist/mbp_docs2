Explode Labels
==============

This option will be made available on SVG export when Deepnest is selected and
the map has labels applied. When selected it will explode the sketch label
objects into sketch curves before exporting. Deepnest will ignore SVG text but
it will include the exploded curves enabling the labeling to remain with the
rearranged parts.
