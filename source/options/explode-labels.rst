Explode Labels
==============

This option is available for SVG exports when Deepnest is selected and the map has
labels applied. When selected, it will explode the sketch label objects into sketch curves
before exporting. Deepnest will ignore SVG text but include the exploded curves,
enabling the labels to remain with the rearranged components.
