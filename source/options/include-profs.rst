Include Profiles
========================

Choose these options to include profiles in the flat panels created for the SVG or DXF
exports. These exports require at least one profile to be selected, otherwise a warning
popup will display, requiring a selection before you can proceed.

Shown below the profile types, Perimeters, Cutout, Insets, or Board Perimeters can be
included or excluded in the exported map as a DXF file.
