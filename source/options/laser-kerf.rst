Laser Kerf
==========

.. role:: blue

Laser Kerf will adjust one half of the laser kerf value outside each component perimeter
and one half of the laser kerf inside inner cutouts. The name implies utility for laser
manufacturing, but it could also be used when working with a CNC to account for a
router bit diameter.

The value of this setting is a floating-point number in the current default units. This
option is available for map exports of SVG or DXF as a flat panel.

Showed here is an Export Map to SVG task with a :blue:`Laser Kerf` value of 0.01 mm.
