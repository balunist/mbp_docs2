Cutlist
=======

When set, a CSV file is created containing the following:

    - a table with all placed components, including Board No., Quantity, Component
      Name, Material Type, Width, Length and Thickness
    - a lumber list required to manufacture the model, which includes the quantity and
      dimensions for each material type

Selecting the :ref:`group_common-label` option will gather components with matching
dimensions into a single line, incrementing the quantity.

The example cutlist is below which had this option set. The first line shows two 
components that had the same dimensions on board 1 named, **top** and **bottom**, 
which were combined and given a quantity of 2.
