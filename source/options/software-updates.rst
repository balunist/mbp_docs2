Software Updates
================

Make certain the **Software Updates** setting is enabled in setting. This will
insure that important add-in updates are downloaded in a timely manor avoiding
interruptions. When set and the add-in is run updates are downloaded, when
available, that include changes needed to remain compatible with Fusion 360.
If not set you may need to download and rerun the updated installer from App
Store.

Shown below is the **Software Updates** setting. When set the add-in will
automatically download and install the latest version that has been verified
to be compatible with the production version of Fusion 360.
