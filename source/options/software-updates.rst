Software Updates
================

Make certain the **Software Updates** setting is enabled in settings. This will ensure that
important add-in updates are downloaded in a timely manner, avoiding interruptions.
When the setting is enabled and the add-in is run, updates that include changes needed
to remain compatible with Fusion 360 are downloaded when available. If the setting is
disabled, you may need to download and rerun the updated installer from the App
Store.

Shown below is the **Software Updates** setting. When set, the add-in will automatically
download and install the latest version verified to be compatible with the production
version of Fusion 360.
