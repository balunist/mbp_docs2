Glass Boards
============

.. role:: blue

This option is available in the option tab of the MapBoards Pro app.  When
creating a map with component bodies boards will be create in full thickness
as :blue:`glass`.

This option makes no functional difference and it is purely for looks.  The
boards are made non-selectable so you can easily slide components around to
reposition. I added this option because I liked the effects.  Use it if you
wish.

:blue:`Note:` Selected this option has no functional affect, including in a
manufacturing model, since the Manufacturing Model task will create a setup
with appropriate thickness with of without the board showing thickness. It is
purely for aesthetics.
