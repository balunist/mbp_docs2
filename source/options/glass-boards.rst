Glass Boards
============

.. role:: blue

This option is available in the option tab of the MapBoards Pro app. When creating a
map with component bodies, boards will be created in full thickness as :blue:`glass`.

This option makes no functional difference and is purely for looks. The boards are made
non-selectable so you can easily slide components around to reposition. I added this
option because I liked the effects. Use it if you wish.

:blue:`Note:` Selecting this option has no functional affect, including in a manufacturing model,
since the Manufacturing Model task will create a setup with appropriate thickness with
or without the board showing thickness. It is purely for aesthetics.
