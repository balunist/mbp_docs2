Use Appearance
==============

.. role:: blue

When :blue:`Use Appearance` is selected, all components in the model are sorted by
appearance instead of the default physical material type. Also, the Board Type list title
will indicate (Appearance) on the lumber tab.

When maps are created, components are placed on the board types of corresponding
appearance and thickness. Typically, one would apply the expected appearance to the
various components in the model, giving it a realistic look. You can also create your own
named appearances and apply them to a sub-group of components. When the map is
created, the subgroups will be arranged together on separate boards.
