Ignore Thickness
================

.. role:: blue

This option controls what unique board types are listed in Lumber tab.

When :blue:`Ignore Thickness` is set unique board types are determined using
the material type only ignoring thickness.  All parts with the same material
type or appearance, depending on the :blue:`Use appearance` setting, will be
mapped to the same board type with a single thickness equal to the thickest of
all parts of that material type.

Shown here is a mapped board created with three part of the same material type
but with 3 different thicknesses and :blue:`Ignore Thickness` set. This
example has the :blue:`Create Board as Glass` option set for effect.
