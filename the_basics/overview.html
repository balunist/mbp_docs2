<h1>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#settings" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When MapBoards Pro (MBP) is first installed, there are default settings. When you
invoke MapBoards Pro on a model, the Lumber tab will display a list of
<span class="blue-bold">Board Types</span> found in the model. A board type is the pairing of material type and board
thickness (height). Material type refers to either the physical material or the appearance base
selected in <span class="blue-bold">Use Appearance</span>, found in the options tab.  All components
are grouped by their material type and thickness. Each unique group results in a board type entry
in the list presented on the Lumber tab</p>
<p>The board type’s thickness, by default, is the shortest dimension of the matching components.
When possible, an <span class="blue-bold">Alternate Thickness</span>, taken from the width of the matching components
is made available in a dropdown list for the <span class="blue-bold">Height</span>.</p>
<p>With each board type there are two dimensions, width and length, which will be used as the
default board size when creating a map. The first time a material type is encountered these
values will be set large enough to accommodate the largest component of that board type.
The <span class="blue-bold">Options tab</span> will reveal these default settings. If you make any changes
to these default dimensions or settings, they will persist the next time you invoke MBP on
this model.</p>
<p>If you want the current settings to be the default on all models being opened for the first
time, you can press the <span class="blue-bold">Save as Default</span> button in the Options tab. In addition to making
the settings in the Option tab the default, it will also make the board type dimensions
the default for the respective board types.</p>
</section>
<section id="board-dimensions">
<h2>Board Dimensions<a class="headerlink" href="#board-dimensions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The dimension settings for each board type, Width (vertical Y direction) and Length (the
horizontal X direction), define the default targeted boards dimensions. When MBP is
run, it will create enough boards with these dimensions to accommodate the mapping
of all the component bodies matching this board type. You should configure the
orientation, either portrait mode (larger width) or landscape mode (larger length), to
match the targeted machine you will be manufacturing your model on.</p>
<p>Using just these default board dimensions is a good starting point and may be all you will
ever need. However, MapBoards Pro offers the ability to create multiple dimensions for
a board type. Using <span class="blue-bold">Material Management</span>, you can create a finite list of dimensional
boards for each board type. This can be shared across all models.</p>
</section>
<section id="board-arrangements">
<h2>Board Arrangements<a class="headerlink" href="#board-arrangements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Boards are arranged using one of three arrangement types available in the <span class="blue-bold">Arrange Type</span> option.
This allows you to match your needs for rip cuts, cross cuts, or a more random diagonal fill
pattern. These arrangements are <span class="blue-bold">NOT</span> true nesting, but they are optimal for most users and can
be performed reasonably fast. The placement is done using a tight bounding box around each
component with options for component spacing and a reserved edge on boards.</p>
</section>
<section id="grain-direction">
<h2>Grain Direction<a class="headerlink" href="#grain-direction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>MBP deals with <span class="blue-bold">Grain Direction</span> in a number of ways. Firstly, the dimensions of the target boards include a
directional button used to toggle between the vertical Y direction <img alt="vertical" class="no-scaled-link" src="../_images/Vertical.png" style="height: 2.5ex;" /> or the horizontal X direction <img alt="horizontal" class="no-scaled-link" src="../_images/Horizontal.png" style="height: 2.5ex;" />.
Besides the Board Types list on the Lumber tab, you can also optionally create and manage stock using
<span class="blue-bold">Material Management</span>. These lumber lists also have a selectable grain direction for each defined board.</p>
<p>When MBP arranges components on a board it will align the long edge of a component with the targeted board’s
grain direction by default, with a few exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the option <a class="reference internal" href="../options/rotate.html#rotate-label"><span class="std std-ref">Can Rotate</span></a> is selected, a component may have its long edge rotated perpendicular
to the targeted  board grain direction. This will only occur if it would better utilize space or if none of the
remaining components  would fit an available space with the component long edge and board grain aligned.</p></li>
<li><p>When a component is selected, it is displayed in the selection table with the option to rotate the selected component.
When the rotate option is selected, this will force the component  to be rotated  with its long edge perpendicular to
the board grain direction.</p></li>
<li><p>When the <span class="blue-bold">Automatic Grain Alignment</span> option is set, components with a 3D appearance will have their 3D
grain aligned with the target board grain. When modeling, you can rotate the 3D grain as desired, and the corresponding
component will be mapped to the target board and aligned with its grain.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="modifying-created-map">
<h2>Modifying Created Map<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-created-map" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Once selected, a component can be flipped by right-clicking and selecting the <span class="blue-bold">Flip</span> command from the context menu.
This will flip the component in place, maintaining alignment with the board grain direction.</p>
<p>Once the map is created, you can modify the location and rotation of a component within or between boards a couple
of ways:.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Click on the <span class="blue-bold">Top</span> face of the orientation cube <img alt="cube" class="no-scaled-link" src="../_images/OrientationCube.png" style="height: 3.5ex;" /> located in the upper right corner of the window to align the map facing
forward. You can then slide the component to the desired location within or between boards. Rotation is not possible
using this method.</p>
<p>or</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the <span class="blue-bold">Top</span> face of the orientation cube <img alt="cube" class="no-scaled-link" src="../_images/OrientationCube.png" style="height: 3.5ex;" /> then select the component you want to move.  Right click and select the
Unsurpassed Joint command, double click on the displayed joint, then move and rotate the component to the desired location, pressing enter
when complete. You can then hide the joint by selecting the component, right click, and selecting the Suppress Joint command.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="tasks-on-created-map">
<h2>Tasks on Created Map<a class="headerlink" href="#tasks-on-created-map" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>It is recommended that you always create a map with component bodies first. You can
then take advantage of the post-mapping tasks on the created map. Performing these
post-mapping tasks is more efficient for performance and provides you with more
options, such as working with modified maps as described above.</p>
<p>After creating or modifying a created map you may want to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Label or re-label the map to align the labeling text with the moved components.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a report with images of the mapped boards in a map, a component
list, and the required board types and quantities to create the design.
Selecting the <span class="blue-bold">Show</span> option for this task opens the created html file in your
default browser for viewing.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a Manufacturing Model with setup for one or more created boards to
continue with the manufacturing process. This would include creating
toolpaths, simulating, then exporting the toolpaths to drive your machine
setup.</p></li>
<li><p>Export the created maps as flat panels in either DXF or SVG files to be used in
other software or machine setups.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="multiple-maps">
<h2>Multiple Maps<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-maps" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You may want to create and keep more than one map. Maps are created under the
top-level component <span class="blue-bold">maps</span> in the browser tree. To create and keep two or more maps,
you must first hide the existing map by turning off the visibility icon. This will prevent
the map from being deleted when MBP is run. Having more than one map allows you to
subdivide your model into separate maps and simplify the manufacturing process. For
example, you may want to create a map for each board type using <span class="blue-bold">Selection Support</span>.
To do this, uncheck <span class="blue-bold">Include Entire Model</span> and either select the individual component or
branches in the browser tree, or select a board type in the list of board types. When
MBP is run, it will only include those selected components to be mapped.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-s-next">
<h2>What’s Next<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-next" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>That is the general overview. Try things out on some simple models. There is much more
functionality available, and you can browse the table of contents in this document or use
the <span class="blue-bold">Quick Search</span> option to find a description of an option or a topic of interest.</p>
